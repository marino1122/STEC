# STEC
STEC is a new spatial-temporal embodied carbon model for embodied carbon accounting.
## Data Model
The data organization is based on SEMANCO, which is a system of energy information to integrate data from multiple data sources. In STEC, the data can be categorized into electricity data (mapping to geographical information in SEMANCO), geographic data (mapping to geographic information in SEMANCO), and hardware-related data (extended SEMANCO).

### Geographic data
|   Country-level  | United States | China | South Korea | Taiwan | Ireland | Italy |
|:----------------:|:-------------:|-------|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| Treaty-zone-level |       EU      | ASEA  | /           | /      | /       | /     |
|   Global-level   |     Global    |   /   | /           | /      | /       | /     |
### Electricity data
|   Daily  | Electricity generated by sources  | 
|:----------------:|:-------------:|
| Monthly |       Carbon intensity of electricity      | 
|   Yearly  |     Carbon intensity of electricity    |  
### Hardware-related data
