# STEC
STEC is a new spatial-temporal embodied carbon model for embodied carbon accounting. 
## Data Schema
The data organization is based on [SEMANCO](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alvaro-Sicilia/publication/262492328_SEMANCO_Semantic_Tools_for_Carbon_Reduction_in_Urban_Planning/links/5836ca9908aed45931c80503/SEMANCO-Semantic-Tools-for-Carbon-Reduction-in-Urban-Planning.pdf), which is a system of energy information to integrate data from multiple data sources. In STEC, the data can be categorized into electricity data (mapping to energy information in SEMANCO), geographic data (mapping to geographic information in SEMANCO), and hardware-related data (extended SEMANCO).

### Geographic data
Along the spatial dimension, there is granularity on country-level, treaty-zone-leveand, and global-level. In country-level, we study the main six IC production countries. Available data for treaty-zone-level contains European Union (EU) and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

### Electricity data
Along the temporal dimension, there is granularity on day-level, season-level, and year-level. Available data for season-level and year-level is monthly and yearly carbon intensity of electricity. However, available data for day-level is the electricity generated by sources, where the carbon intensity of electricity can be calculated based on carbon emission factors.

### Hardware-related data
The hardware-related data contains Electricity consumed per die Size (EPS), Carbon emission from Gas used per die Size (GPS), Carbon emission from Material used per die Size (MPS), Bit density for memory (BD), and Electricity consumed per GB (EPG).

## STEC Models Set
To serve different applications, STEC models are classified by different spatical and temporal granularity, e.g., country-level and day-level (CD), country-level and season-level (CS), and treaty-zone-level and year-level (ZY).
|   Model  | Input | 
|:----------------:|:-------------:|
| STEC-CD |      Hardware-related data +  Electricity data (Daily) + Geographic data (Country-level) | 
|  STEC-CS  |    Hardware-related data +  Electricity data (Monthly) + Geographic data (Country-level) | 
|  STEC-ZY  |    Hardware-related data +  Electricity data (Yearly) + Geographic data (Global-level) |
